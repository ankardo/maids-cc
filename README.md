To run this project, you'll need to follow a few steps. First, make sure you have Yarn installed on your machine. Yarn is a package manager that will help you manage your project's dependencies.

Once you have Yarn installed, navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal or command prompt. From there, you'll need to run the command yarn install. This command will read the package.json file in your project and install all the necessary dependencies.

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the command ng serve dashboard. 

Alternatively, if you prefer to navigate to the apps/dashboard directory in your terminal or command prompt, you can run the command ng serve from there. This will achieve the same result as ng serve dashboard, but it assumes that you are already inside the apps/dashboard directory.
